### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

 I personally enjoyed part 2 of Lab 6 as the challenges it posed were quite interesting to me. 
 Especially the challenge involving aces, where we had to handle their scoring correctly. 
 This required dealing with difficult hands like Ace and Ace, where only one ace should be 
 scored as 10, but the second as 1. Creating the correct if statements to properly handle scoring 
 for any hand made this challenging yet satisfying once correctly completed.
