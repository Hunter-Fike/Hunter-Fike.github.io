### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

 I personally enjoyed part 2 of Lab 6 as the challenges it posed were quite interesting to me. 
 Especially the challenge involving aces, where we had to handle their scoring correctly. 
 This required dealing with difficult hands like Ace and Ace, where only one ace should be 
 scored as 10, but the second as 1. Creating the correct if statements to properly handle scoring 
 for any hand made this challenging yet satisfying once correctly completed.

 * Lab 9

 I enjoyed Lab 9 Part 1 as it gave us a good use for the input file stream and taught us how to 
 loop through files and check conditions within them. The ReadWords function taught us how to take 
 info from a file and put it into a vector that we can use to compare and test things against different 
 files. This allowed us to make a spell checker that was functional for the words in the dictionary file.

* Lab 10

Lab 10 was one of my favorites due to its usefulness and how it can be applied to many situations. 
In this lab, I liked how we used information from a file and performed calculations on it to obtain 
more data, such as population density. This lab demonstrated how code can be used to perform analysis 
and quickly extract desired information from a file.
